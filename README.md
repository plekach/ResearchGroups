# ResearchGroups

Description:
Program that uses the sorting algorithm Merge Sort to sort groups based on group size.
The list of groups are hashed out into a hash array and then converted after being sorted, into the id of the original array.
The groups are then displayed in the terminal, sorted by group length.
